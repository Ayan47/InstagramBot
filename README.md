# INSTAGRAM BOT

## Description
This Bot goes to specific tags randomly and comments/likes and/or follows that user, The idea here is to follow people with lesser followers so that they can do a Follow for Follow.
You can also follow the followers of those who you are following and last but not the least, you can automate this!
**P.S.**: The service will quickly notice that you’re running a bot and will ban some of its actions. That’s why it’s a good idea to set quotas on some of your bot’s actions.
## Cloning the Project
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Ayan47/InstagramBot.git
```
## Prerequisites 

The `BigBazaarScrapper` has the following prerequisites: 

 - **Python 3.7 or newer versions**
 - **Python Library - InstaPy**
 - **geckodriver-v0.29.0-win64.zip `(If Windows User else check for any Firefoxdriver)`**

The InstagramBot has been tested on `Windows 10` Build Version `19042.867`

## Steps to Run the InstagramBot

 - Install `Python 3.7` or newer versions
 - Install the following Python Library- `InstaPy`.
 - We need to use `Mozilla Firefox` as `InstaPy` has removed it's support from `Google Chrome` and hence we will also require`Firefoxdriver.exe` which can be available in a different name [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) 
 - Run the Code
 
### NOTE
As of `25-03-2021` Everything works fine.
